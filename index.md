The Digital Government Strategy is fundamentally an initiative intended to integrate modern technology and best practices into government.  The role of APIs continues to rise across the internet with most websites of note consuming and producing APIs in some fashion, internally and externally.  

**APIs play a role in each of the three Strategy Objectives:**

> 1) *Enable the American people and an increasingly mobile workforce to access high-quality digital government information and services anywhere, anytime, on any device.*

APIs play a central role in supporting mobile apps, mobile websites, and third party re-posting of material to facilitate this goal. 

> 2) *Ensure that as the government adjusts to this new digital world, we seize the opportunity to procure and manage devices, applications, and data in smart, secure and affordable ways.*

The role of mobile devices in the workforce intrinsically relies on the app economy as a means of workplace productivity, requiring an API -centric view of the data and services that staff use every day.  

> 3) *Unlock the power of government data to spur innovation across our Nation and improve the quality of services for the American people.*

By offering agency data through a dynamic API, government is able to expose that data to the third-party developers who are propelling the mobile ecosystem forward and providing so many services to citizens.  

**APIs are central to the Conceptual Model of the Strategy:**

The role of APIs at the Platform Layer is to serve as a flexible buffer between the Information and Presentation Layers.  This supports a more powerful and forward-thinking architecture that enables much of the innovation discussed throughout the Strategy.  

**APIs factor into each of the four Strategy Principles:**

> 1) *[Information-Centric](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html#information-centric)* 

“Providing [all content] through web APIs helps us architect for interoperability and openness and make data assets freely available for use within agencies, between agencies, in the private sector, or by citizens”

> 2) *[Shared Platform](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html#shared-platform)*

“[Agencies] must also share ownership of common service areas, both within and across agencies, instead of creating multiple websites on the same topic.”  Many duplicative services offered by agencies could be phased out as federal APIs spin up - the nature of APIs supports sister agencies consuming each other’s services to avoid the need for duplication.  

> 3) *[Customer-Centric](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html#shared-platform)*

“The customer-centric principle charges us to ... make content more broadly available and accessible and present it through multiple channels in a program- and device-agnostic way....”  This is accomplished in large part through the unlocking of content via APIs.  

> 4) *[Security and Privacy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html#security-and-privacy)*

“When deploying applications and other mobile technologies to interact with citizens and businesses, the Federal Government will need to foster trust, accountability, and transparency about how user information is collected, used, shared, and secured, without unduly burdening the robust development of such technologies or the user experience.”  The rapid growth of APIs online means that each agency must begin to address the changing technology landscape in order to maintain security and privacy.  


**APIs within specific agency milestones:  **

> [Milestone 1.2](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html#milestone-1-1)

After the release of Milestone 1.1 from OMB, agencies are tasked to ensure that all new IT systems comply with the policy and to operationalize agency.gov/developer pages.  Further guidance will be published here upon release of the document and will serve to support implementation of this requirement.  

> [Milestone 2.1](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html#milestone-1-1)

Agencies are tasked to engage with customers to identify at least two existing major customer-facing services that contain high-value data or content as first move candidates to make compliant with the OMB policy released as part of Milestone 1.1.   This process syncs with the guidance on ‘How to get started’. 

> [Milestone 2.2](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html#existing-data)

After the release of Milestone 1.1 from OMB, agencies are tasked to make high-value data and content in at least two existing major customer-facing systems available through web APIs, apply metadata tagging, and publish a plan to transition additional high-value systems.  Further guidance will be published here upon release of the document and will serve to support implementation of this requirement.
